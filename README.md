# vim-42header
a (better) vim header for 42 projects

# Features
* Passes `norminette`
* Updates filename line when changed
* Updates "Updated" line only when buffer is changed
* Works with all formats that default supports
* Binds to `F1` for easy access
* Overrides `:Stdheader` for school vim installs

# Why?
Part of the **Mexican Standoff** rush, I decided to add a few bonus features
and I now use this as my header for 42 files. Please feel free to add things :)!

# Note
Hey, you. If you're also doing the rush, don't steal it! Staff will know. Feel
free to ask me any questions on Slack or e-mail, my login is the same as my
GitHub username.

Good luck, and thanks for all the fish!
